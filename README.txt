Welcome to the USB-to-Sero-Controller Interface Project!

This program allows you to control servos from a custom USB device using the 
Python Programming language.  

To get started, you'll need a combination of hardware and software before 
being able to run these examples:

Hardware:
-- A Teensy 2.0
   Source: http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html
Software:
-- PyUSB
   Source: http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/pyusb/
-- Arduino 1.0.1 Teensyduino installation

  Riding on the shoulders of giants, this project would be impossible without 
the incredible starter code provided by Paul Stoffregen found in the examples 
tab under:  File-->Examples-->Teensy-->USB_RawHID-->Basic.
